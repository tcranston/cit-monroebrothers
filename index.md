We provide consultancy in the field of low temperature engineering.  We specialise in the technologies using liquid nitrogen at -196°C to provide fast and effective cooling for industrial and scientific applications and also liquid helium down to 1.4 K for scientific applications.  Examples include pollution control with liquid nitrogen and superconducting magnet design with liquid helium.

The company can apply analytical techniques to quantify the technical issues and design skills to create a working solution, delivering the work as engineering drawings, documented design and formal presentations.
