We can prepare technical specifications for the supply of equipment and systems.

Judgement is needed to define a clear boundary for the supplier's responsibility in the scope of supply.  At the same time clarity in the decsription is needed to define the requirements clearly whilst also giving the supplier latitude to offer variations in the design either to improve the design or to suit their experience and manufacturing skills.
