Monroe Brothers Ltd can design process control systems to maintain stable operating conditions with an efficient use of cryogens or cooling power.  This is based on an undertsanding of the system, theoretical modelling and experience.  The task can include a detailed specification for developing the control software, typically operating on a programmable logic controller (PLC), and also the manufacture of the control system.

Some previous control tasks are listed below:

  ~  Liquid nitrogen cooled pollution abatement systems;
  ~  Liquid nitrogen cooled systems for pharmaceutical reaction cooling at 120 kW and -120&deg;C;
  ~  Closed loop helium refrigeration systems for superconducting RF cavities at Diamond Light Source Ltd and NSLS-II, Brookhaven National Laboratory
  ~  Liquid helium cooled cryostats at 2.2 K for NMR spectroscopy magnets;
  ~  Liquid helium cooled systems at 1.1 K for Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation;
  ~  Vacuum drying systems for nuclear waste;
  ~  Helium gas cooling systems at 150 K and 6 kW.
