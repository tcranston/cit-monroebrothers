A cryostat is a chamber to operate at low temperatures for the purposes of running an experiment or operating equipment.  It can be cooled continuously in a closed loop from an external refrigerator, by a cryocooler built into it or by the supply of cryogens which slowly boil away and thus maintain a low temperature.

Monroe Brothers Ltd has extensive experience of designing cryostats as listed below.

* A low heat loss cryostat for an NMR magnet which required filling with 200litres of liquid helium only once per year.

* A cryogen free cryostat for the TF coils of a small tokamak operating at 30 K and cooled by a Sumitomo cryocooler.

* A large cryostat for a 900 MHz NMR magnet providing stable operation at 2.3 K for the superconducting magnet.

* The cryostats for liquid helium superconducting RF cavities which are cooled from a lqiud helium refrigerator.

* Liquid nitrogen cooled cryostats for radio telescope detectors.
