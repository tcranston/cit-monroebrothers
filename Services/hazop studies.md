A HAZOP study undertales a HAZard and OPerability study of system.  The first priority is the safety of the system by eliminating hazards.  At the same time the study will identify and mitigate against operability issues.  A HAZOP study is best undertaken when the design is complete and before the manufacture has started; at this stage the design issues can be identified clearly whilst the cost of mitigations is at its lowest.  When managed correctly the HAZOP study is not an overhead cost in order to satisfy safety requirement but a useful tool to deliver a workable system as well as a safe system.

Monroe Brothers Ltd has the experience to chair a HAZOP study for process systems and equipment in order to deliver a safe and workable system.  These have been undertaken for NMR spectroscopy systems, cryogenic systems operating superconducting RF cavities, liquid nitrogen fill systems for biological storage and closed loop helium gas circulation systems.
