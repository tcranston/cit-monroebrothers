Monroe Brothers Ltd can design process cooling systems whether this involves 300 kW at -120°C for cooling of a reaction process, 700 W of cooling at 4.5 K for superconducting RF cavities using a helium liquefier or 100 mW at 1.2 K for specialist spectroscopy experiments.  We have the experience for dimensioning the valves pipelines and heat exchangers for two phase systems using helium and nitrogen. we can also specify the process control system to achieve a stable operation.

The clients for these applications have included a number of synchrotrons using superconducting RF cavities (Diamond Light Source Ltd, Daresbury Laboratory, Cockcroft Institute, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Canadian Light Source Inc), Oxford Instruments for high resolution NMR spectroscopy at 2.2 K, Air Products for process cooling of pollution abatement systems or reactions cooling systems and Culham Centre for Fusion Energy for cooling of cryopumps in a tokamak experiment.
