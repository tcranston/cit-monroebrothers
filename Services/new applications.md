We are always interested in new applications.  This could be helium cooling at ultra low temperatures, a system which is part of a helium refrigeration circuit.  It could also be an application for liquid nitrogen which takes advantage of the particular attributes of liquid nitrogen which are a low investment cost, peak cooling loads and of course low temperatures down to -200°C.

In addition, the analytical techniques developed through decades of working on cryogenics can be used to develop cooling processes using conventional refrigeration systems.  Therefore we are interested in helping to design a solution for any cooling problem.
